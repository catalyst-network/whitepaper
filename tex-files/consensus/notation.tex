For the sake of clarity, here is a dictionary of the variables used in the proceeding description of the consensus mechanism:

\begin{itemize}

\item $p$ - A single producer that has been selected randomly to perform work for the network for a given cycle.
\item $P$ - The pool of producers who have been selected through the producer selection mechanism for the particular cycle being described. It is made up of a set of producers $p$
\item $T$ - The mempool of any given producer $p$. It contains a group of transactions that will be used in the update for a given cycle.
\item $t$ - A single transaction that is found within the mempool $T$.
\item $u$ - The local ledger state update generated by a single producer node. This is what that particular node believes to be the correct update for the given cycle.
\item $\sigma$ - A pseudorandomly generated number, used as a salt.
\item $E$ - The list of entries found within a single transaction $t$. A producer will produce one of these lists for each valid transaction in $T$.
\item $d$ - A hash tree containing all the signatures extracted from the transactions in $T$.
\item $H$ - A hash of each list $E$ combined with the salt $\sigma$.
\item $L$ - Alphanumerically ordered list of the pairs $E,H$, sorted according to $H$.
\item $G$ - The list of proposed updates $u$ that producer $p$ collects from other nodes in producer pool $P$. This is used to determine the most popular update.
\item $\mathcal{L}(prod)$ - The list of producers from a particular producers' set $G$ that sent the most popular ledger state update.
\item $L_{CE}$ - A producers list of compensation entries \textit{i.e.} who a producer believes did the correct work for the network and thereby should be rewarded.
\item $\mathcal{L}(vote)$ - The list of producers a specific producer found to have forwarded the correct vote for the most popular ledger state update.
\item $LSU$ - Ledger State Update. This is the final ledger state update proposed by a producer node. It consists of the list of entries used to create the update, the hash tree containing the signatures and the list of compensation entries.
\item $V$ - A producers vote for the correct $LSU$ formed of the hash of the LSU, $L_{vote}$ and the producer's ID.
\item $\mathbf{o}$ - The final producer output that is declared to the network.
\end{itemize}
