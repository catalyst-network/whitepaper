EVM is the run-time environment that enables smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It relies on the fact that when a smart contract is ran upon two different machine using the same inputs both machines will retrieve the same output i.e. it is deterministic. Smart contracts can be written primarily in the Solidity language.
