As EVM requires smart contract developers to write in Solidity this can prove to be restrictive. The KVM allows smart contracts to be able to write smart contracts in a wide variety of languages. \\

The KVM extends the range of Opcodes that are available on the EVM through the use of precompiles. 

Examples of the additional pre-compiles that are added are: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item Range proof - Allows a range proof to be built 
\item Read DFS -
\item Write DFS -
\end{itemize} 

The use of precompiles rather than the addition of new opcodes means that KVM can retain interoperability with the EVM in the future.
