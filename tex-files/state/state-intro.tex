The global ledger state is the current state of all the accounts in the Catalyst Network. This state is not stored in the delta, instead a copy of the ledger state is stored by all participating nodes and updated each ledger cycle. The ledger state consists of a mapping between account addresses and information about those accounts â€“ such as their balance, and how many transactions have been made previously using that account.
