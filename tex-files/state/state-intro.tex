The global ledger state is the current state of all the accounts in the Catalyst Network. The state contains a key and value pair for every account. The `key' is the account address and the `value' contains account details such as the current account balance, and the number of previous transactions created from that account. A newly created account will only become part of the ledger state once it receives a transfer of Kats.

The global ledger state is not stored in the delta, instead a copy of the ledger state is stored by all participating nodes and updated each ledger cycle.
