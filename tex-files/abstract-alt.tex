Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) over the last decade have grown at an extraordinary rate, with new technologies being announced, developed and released on a daily basis. A majority of these technologies have not progressed from the original concepts set out by Satoshi Nakamoto in his seminal paper \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} with regards to speed, security, scalability and decentralisation. There has however been a clear demonstration for the appetite and innovation for wider markets to adopt these technologies. Catalyst marries together many existing technologies as well as some novel ones in order to create a framework which give a fast, scalable and fair ledger.
